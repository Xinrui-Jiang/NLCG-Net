# NLCG-Net: A Model-Based Zero-Shot Learning Framework for Undersampled Quantitative MRI Reconstruction

Codes for T2 case have been optimised to be more compliant with the specification, making it easier to implement by specifying parameters in 'parser_ops.py'. Note that the work output is being developed into a journal paper, and the latest NLCG-Net turns out to be more powerful than when it was firstly purposed (08/11/2023).

1/2024 This version of code is being further organized so that it can be more reader-friendly. 't1' refers to T1 mapping, and 't2' refers to T2 mapping. Differences are mainly in 'data_consistency.py' because they have different imaging bases and raw data. Please feel free to comment if you meet any problem running codes
